Program Description:

Program allows you to take a detailed inventory or snapshot of a directory and 
automatically stores the information or tree hierarchy to a '.snap' file within
an automatically created 'snapshots' directory. It then allows you to compare 
several '.snap' files and display any differences in terms of added or removed 
sub-directories or files. Below is example output when the program is started.
Currently program is CLI based but a future Version will also allow the program
to be run via GUI.

Upcoming features planned to be added in a future release include:
- storing the entire directory/file path for each entry
- showing directories/files edited along with the current display of added/removed directories/files
- allowing the user to specify where to store '.snap' files if default directory is not desirable
- allowing the automatic upload of '.snap' files to FTP
- allowing for renaming and deleting '.snap' files
- GUI
