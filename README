submenu. User is now able to enable FTP functionality. Once FTP is enabled, all '.snap'
files created by the program are also copied/uploaded to a FTP server.

- Cleaned-up code


Program Description:

Program allows you to take a detailed inventory or snapshot of a directory and 
automatically stores the information or tree hierarchy to a ".snap" file within
an automatically created 'snapshots' directory. It then allows you to compare 
several '.snap' files and display any differences in terms of added or removed 
sub-directories or files. Below is example output when the program is started.
User can also enable FTP functionality which will upload a copy of the '.snap' 
program-created files to a FTP server.Currently program is CLI based but a 
future version will also allow the program to be run via GUI.
