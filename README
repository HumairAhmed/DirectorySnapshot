Updates/New in 2.1:

- Added 'Settings' option to main menu. Setting option leads the user to another new
submenu. User is now able to enable FTP functionality. Once FTP is enabled, all '.snap'
files created by the program are also copied/uploaded to a FTP server.

- Cleaned-up code


Program Description:

Program allows you to take a detailed inventory or snapshot of a directory and 
automatically stores the information or tree hierarchy to a ".snap" file within
an automatically created 'snapshots' directory. It then allows you to compare 
several '.snap' files and display any differences in terms of added or removed 
sub-directories or files. Below is example output when the program is started.
User can also enable FTP functio.nality which will upload a copy of the '.snap' 
program-created files to a FTP server.Currently program is CLI based but a 
future version will also allow the program to be run via GUI.
